=head1 NAME

Map::Tube::Plugin::Graph - Graph plugin for Map::Tube.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.48

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's a graph plugin for L<Map::Tube> to create map of individual lines defined as
Moo Role. Once installed, it gets plugged into Map::Tube::* family.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict; use warnings;
    use MIME::Base64;
    use Map::Tube::London;

    my $tube = Map::Tube::London->new;

    # Entire map image to STDOUT
    binmode(STDOUT);
    print STDOUT $tube->as_png;

    # Entire map image
    my $name = $tube->name;
    open(my $MAP_IMAGE, ">", "$name.png")
        or die "ERROR: Can't open [$name.png]: $!";
    binmode($MAP_IMAGE);
    print $MAP_IMAGE decode_base64($tube->as_image);
    close($MAP_IMAGE);

    # Just a particular line map image
    my $line = 'Bakerloo';
    open(my $LINE_IMAGE, ">", "$line.png")
        or die "ERROR: Can't open [$line.png]: $!";
    binmode($LINE_IMAGE);
    print $LINE_IMAGE decode_base64($tube->as_image($line));
    close($LINE_IMAGE);

=head1 INSTALLATION

The plugin primarily depends on GraphViz2 library. But GraphViz2 as of 2.61 can
only be installed on perl v5.008008 or above.

For example, on my Windows 11 box running WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS), try this:

    $ sudo apt install libgraphviz2-perl

=head1 METHODS

=head2 as_graph

Returns a C<multiedged>, directed L<Graph> object with the entire map.
You can do graph-theory stuff with it yourself, or even control a
visualisation using the L<GraphViz2/from_graph> API:

  use Map::Tube::London;
  # a convention with GraphViz2 is to have a separate decorating function:
  sub graphvizify {
    my ($g) = @_;
    my $l2c = $g->get_graph_attribute('line2colour');
    for my $ft ($g->edges) {
      $g->set_edge_attribute_by_id(@$ft, $_, graphviz=>{color=>$l2c->{$_}})
        for $g->get_multiedge_ids(@$ft);
    }
  }
  $tube = Map::Tube::London->new;
  $g = $tube->as_graph->undirected_copy_attributes; # make undirected version
  graphvizify($g);
  binmode STDOUT;
  print +GraphViz2->from_graph($g)
    ->run(format=>"png",driver=>"neato") # neato, because dot is bad undirected
    ->dot_output;

Or you can show only two lines using L<Graph/filter_edges>:

  # uses same graphvizify as above
  $g = $tube->as_graph->undirected_copy_attributes; # make undirected version
  my %keep = map +($_=>1), qw(Central Northern);
  $g->filter_edges(sub { $keep{$_[3]} });
  $g->filter_vertices(sub { !$_[0]->is_isolated_vertex($_[1]) });
  graphvizify($g);
  # binmode and print as above

=cut

sub as_graph {
  my ($self) = @_;
  my $g = Graph->new(multiedged=>1);
  my (%station2line, %station2station);
  for my $station (@{ $self->get_stations }) {
    my $from = $station->id;
    @{ $station2line{$from} }{ map $_->name, @{$station->line} } = ();
    @{ $station2station{$from} }{
      map $self->get_node_by_id($_)->id, split /\,/,$station->link
    } = ();
    $g->add_vertex($from);
    $g->set_vertex_attribute( $from, graphviz => { label => $station->name } );
  }
  for my $from (keys %station2station) {
    my @tos = keys %{$station2station{$from}};
    for my $line (keys %{ $station2line{$from} }) {
      for my $to_on_line (grep exists $station2line{$_}{$line}, @tos) {
        # gives false positive for Northern between Waterloo and Bank
        $g->add_edge_by_id($from, $to_on_line, $line);
        delete $station2station{$from}{$to_on_line};
      }
    }
  }
  delete $station2station{$_}
    for grep !keys %{$station2station{$_}}, keys %station2station;
  for my $f (sort keys %station2station) {
    warn qq{Map has link from "$f" to "$_" but no lines in common\n}
      for sort keys %{$station2station{$f}};
  }
  $g->set_graph_attribute(line2colour=>+{
    map +($_->name=>$_->color), @{$self->lines}
  });
  $g;
}

=head2 as_png($line_name)

The C<$line_name> param is optional. If it's passed, the method returns
the given line map. Otherwise you get the entire map.

See L</SYNOPSIS> for more details on how it can be used.

=cut

sub as_png {
  my ($self, $line_name) = @_;
  defined $line_name
    ? graph_line_image($self, $line_name)
    : graph_map_image($self);
}

=head2 as_image($line_name)

The C<$line_name> param is optional. If it's passed, the method returns the base64
encoded string of the given line map. Otherwise you would get the entire map as
base64 encoded string.

See L</SYNOPSIS> for more details on how it can be used.

sub as_image {
  my ($self, $line_name) = @_;
  encode_base64($self->as_png($line_name));
